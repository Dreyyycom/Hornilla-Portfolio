What UI/UX principles did you apply and why?
I kept the design simple, consistent, and responsive so it looks clean, easy to use, and works well on different devices.
What challenges did you face and how you solved them?
I had trouble with the layout and choosing the right colors at first, but I solved it by organizing the sections better and sticking to a clear color scheme.
How would you improve the portfolio next?
I’d add more projects, some interactive features, and improve accessibility to make it more engaging and user-friendly.
